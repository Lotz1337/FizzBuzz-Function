# FizzBuzz-Function

This repository contains a JavaScript function that takes a number as input and prints values from 1 to that number. 
However, the function includes specific conditions: 
if a number is divisible by 3, it logs "fizz" instead of the number; 
if divisible by 5, it logs "buzz"; and if divisible by both 3 and 5, it logs "fizzbuzz". 

This simple yet versatile function provides a classic FizzBuzz implementation for educational and testing purposes.

How to Use:

Include the fizzBuzz function in your JavaScript project.
Call the function with a numerical argument to see the FizzBuzz output.
